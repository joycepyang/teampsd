## Setting up the R environment and datasets
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(magrittr)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(psych)
```


```{r, include=FALSE}
#set up both files as dataframes
comparator.df <- read.csv("comparatorsites_nov23_16.csv", header=TRUE) 
dropout.df <- read.csv(file="dropout.csv",header=TRUE) 

#set all variable names as lower case
names(comparator.df) <- tolower(names(comparator.df))

names(dropout.df) <- tolower(names(dropout.df))

variable.names(comparator.df)
variable.names(dropout.df)

```


## Setup the CDW Comparator Data part 1

```{r numeric, include=TRUE}
##Set variables as numeric in order to manipulate later
#set up in original CDW 
##create combined variable in comparator.df based on the variable 'year' and the variable 'quarter'

comparator.df <- comparator.df %>%
  mutate_at(vars(totalencounters:x._cbt_sud_sessions), as.numeric) %>%
  mutate(year_q  = paste0(year, "-", quarter), 
         site_yq = paste0(sta6a,"-",year_q))

```

##create combined variable in dropout.df; note that quarters in comparator are fiscal year quarters with Oct 1 start

```{r}
dropout.df <- dropout.df %>% 
  mutate(date_1 = as.character(date_1),
         date_1 = as.Date(date_1, "%m/%d/%Y"),
         year = year(date_1), 
         quarter = quarter(date_1, with_year = FALSE, fiscal_start = 10),
         quarter = paste0("Q", quarter),
         year_q = paste0(year, "-", quarter),
         site_yq = paste0(sta6a,"-",year_q)) 

table(dropout.df$year, useNA = 'ifany')
## Where are there 3 obs whose year is beyond 2016? --> data entry errors
## About 40% of the data doesn't have any year record. Will this impact the analysis?


```
##NEW CODE
## Setup the CDW Comparator Data part 2
## Select CDW for dates that match the CPT database, which is from May 9, 2012 (2012Q3) - September 2, 2016 (2016Q4).  
##CDW data ranges from 2011Q4 until 2016Q3. Overlap is from 2012Q3 until 2016Q3 (although that does not fully cover CPT dates, since CPT goes to 2016Q4. What do we do about this?)
## Must select for CDW only from 2012Q2 to 2016Q3

##select the subset of comparator that we want to work with: here we are selecting for all quarters except for Q5 (i.e., Q1-4), as well as selecting for when the level of the data is read at sta6a (i.e., not examining data read in at the sta3n level) and when the stopcodes are ALL (i.e., not examining data broken down to stopcodes of SUD and PTSD)
```{r}

compsub.df <- comparator.df %>%
  filter(year_q %in% c("2012-Q3", "2012-Q4", "2013-Q1", "2013-Q2", "2013-Q3", "2013-Q4", "2014-Q1", "2014-Q2", "2014-Q3", "2014-Q4", "2015-Q1", "2015-Q2", "2015-Q3", "2015-Q4", "2016-Q1", "2016-Q2", "2016-Q3"  )) %>%
  filter(level == "sta6a") %>%
  filter(stopcode == "ALL") %>% 
  select(level, stopcode, quarter, year, quarteryear, sta6a, totalencounters, patientpanel, providerpanel, psychiatrists, psychologists, socialworkers, nursepractitioners, evalencounter, psychencounter, ptsd_ebpsyeligible, pe_initial_appoints, cpt_initial_appoints, site_yq, sta6acomplexity, tmh, psychmmencounter, groupencounter, mmencounter, casemanagement, telephoneencounter, otherencounter, depression_ebpsyeligible, cbt_d_initial_appoints, act_initial_appoints, ipt_initial_appoints)

```

##create new dataframe that merges the two datasets on the site_yq variable
```{r}
merge.df <- merge.data.frame(compsub.df, dropout.df, by = "site_yq")
summary (merge.df)
```

## to find unique sta6a in the comparator: 
```{r}
length(unique(comparator.df$sta6a))
##The unique length of sta6a is 1627 in comparator
```

##to find unique sta6a in the merged dataset:
```{r}
length(unique(merge.df$sta6a.x))
##The unique length of sta6a is 265 in merged dataset; I'm not sure why it became sta6a.x and sta6a.y; however the unique length for both is the same.


##Examine Total Encounters
```{r}
mean(merge.df$totalencounters)
sd(merge.df$totalencounters)
```

```{r}
group_by_(merge.df$sta6a.x) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(merge.df$totalencounter))

##"Error in UseMethod("group_by_") : no applicable method for 'group_by_' applied to an object of class "factor""


```{r}
group_by_(merge.df$quarteryear) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(merge.df$totalencounter))
```
