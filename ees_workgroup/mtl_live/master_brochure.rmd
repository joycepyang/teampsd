# *Modeling to Learn*

## Title of Program: Experiments and Decisions, Session X (4 through 12)

## Client Program Office: National Center for PTSD, Training and Dissemination Division

## Program Start Date(s) and time(s): TBD

## Purpose Statement: ## 

The purpose of this course is to empower local clinic staff to use real-time clinic data and a customized system modeling tool to make decisions that optimize their delivery of timely, evidence-based psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies (EBPs).

Over the past decade, Veterans Health Administration has invested in the dissemination of EBPs in the outpatient mental health system based on substantial evidence of EBP effectiveness as compared to usual care.1-3 EBPs are high-value treatments that meet veterans’ mental health care needs and can reduce chronic impairment and prevent suicide and overdose.4-9 Despite their demonstrated effectiveness, however, access to EBPs is not always timely and the reach of EBPs for common and costly high-risk conditions like PTSD, depression and opioid use disorder often are low (3%- 28%).10-12 For these reasons, the Veterans Administration prioritizes high-value quality improvement initiatives to increase timely Veteran access to effective mental health care.

Modeling to Learn provides tools for visualizing real-time team data and simulating the effects of team decisions on EBP reach. Through a series of remotely facilitated workshops, front line staff use these tools to build systems thinking capacity; increase their understanding of interrelated factors affecting team outcomes – including decisions within their control; conduct virtual experiments to test the effects of various team decisions on multiple desired outcomes; and make team decisions to optimize EBP reach within existing resource constraints.

## Target Audience: Multidisciplinary staff teams in VAHS outpatient mental health clinics:
- Psychiatrists
- Psychologists
- Social workers
- Nurses
- Counselors
- Certified peer-support specialists
- Other professional disciplines; and 
- Trainees (e.g., practicum, intern, resident and fellow)

## Accreditations: 
- ACCME
- APA
- ANCC
- NBCC
- ASWB
- NYSED

## **Objectives:** 
1. Describe relationships between team decisions and the team’s delivery of evidence-based psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies (EBPs).
2. Develop hypotheses about team decisions that could improve EBP reach.
3. Describe likely impacts of team decisions like overbooking and target return visit intervals on metrics such as no-show rates, new patient start rates, and patients completing a recommended course of treatment.
4. Decide team practices to improve EBP reach with existing resources.
