question: We are frequently asked to do 30 minute appointments instead of EBPsy, which is more beneficial, in terms of the number of Veterans we serve? Are there differences in these impacts (duration of engagement; # of Veterans served)  by diagnosis? Does increasing the proportion of appointment supply for EBPsy increase wait-times for care coordination? What should the proportion of appointment supply be for EBPsy and intakes/care coordination?  

hypothesis: We expect that the impact of EBPsy is that Veterans would be engaged in treatment for a shorter duration to "get better" vs. doing shorter appointments, but see them for a longer period of time. We expect that if we do more EBPsy for shorter duration we will serve more Veterans than we do with 30 minute visits over a longer period of time. If we fill up slots with EBPsy appointments, then access is reduced because wait-times increase, and then we need to refer out of the team (i.e., Choice). We expect that we do 5 EBPsy per week.  

findings:  

decisions: Decision #1: Use the data tools to identify current proportions of appointment supply.
