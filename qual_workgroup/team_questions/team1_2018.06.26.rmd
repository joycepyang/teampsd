question: Our question is how do we get more patients to complete a full course of EBPsy.  If we start more patients what happens to the downstream service states (initiate, complete), etc.  

hypothesis: We expect that the more patients we start we won't have enough supply to see them, and so we wouldn't be able to see patients as frequently. It may also increase drop-out.  

findings:  

decision:
