question: What is the impact of the loss of two psychotherapists (a psychologist and social worker) on team services, specifically intake, treatment coordination, psychotherapy, managing crises, and the associated team fatigue and burnout.  

hypothesis: We expect that the appointment supply is reduced by ~60% across psychotherapy, care coordination and intakes. Because the appointment supply for these services is reduced it will increase the number of patients waiting to start these three services. May want to experiment with within team referrals to services (group, practicum students).  

findings:  

decisions:   
Decision #1: We would like to work with a parameter file that includes practicum student grids (50% of them).   
Decision #2: Interim team lead decided.    
Decision #3: Explore inclusion of psychiatrist from another team for psychotherapy and  possibly attending team meetings.
