JB notes

10-10:15 getting the full team in and introduced

10:15 to 10:30 data UI to sim
Model Diagram, etc.

LZ 30 minutes

TR what if we made some changes in the clinic set at the values we estimated for your team, no experiments.

TR we can still learn something from running a base case.

TR What do you think the proportion in less than 3 months and longer 3 months?

Psy: 
Can you repeat that question?

TR We're keeping track of engagement within the first 12 weeks of their individual psychotherapy with PCT. 

TR Intakes 

Team lead (SW): 80% engaged in psychotherapy in first three months. 20% of patients have been with you more than 3 months.
Psy
: Probably a lot of our therapy clients are in the > 3 months category. Guess 65%, but I'm not sure.

TR: We don't get to think in this aggregate whole patient panel 

SW: How quickly are people starting? How long are they staying once they start? How long are people in psychotherapy from the time they start?

TR: Not the where are they now question

SW: Staying with us longer than 3 months. How are we counting how people are dropping out? Sometimes its seasonal.

LZ: Zoomed in on individual psychotherapy. But, the aggregate module looks at intakes to a mix of services including group, adjunctive services, etc. 

TR: Links to drop-out - the model diagram.

LZ: The suspense is killing us. Running it.

Psy: So about 65% add together, 1 visit, 2-7 visits and 3 or more.

LZ: In the outputs you did a back of the envelope, exactly right. Proportion of appointments you used for these patients.

Psy: 65% of appointments are for patients in care > 3 months.

TR: You don't have to do the math, there's a graph that shows it.

LZ: Basecase stable, so you can look at experiments and see the impact of a specific change. These show "what is" whereas the experiments, would show "what if."

TR: Can go back to the data UI to see how these graphs relate to the clinics and visits in the data UI.

Psy: Can we look to see where these patients are coming from?

LZ: 

Psy: Monterey referrals take longer, where are they are coming from, they have no where else to go.

SW: The psychotherapy you're looking at is not just EBPsy

LZ: Go back to the data UI to see the CPT codes in the encounter tab and to see the EBP templates in the "HF" or health factor tab.

LZ: You can drill down to review specific components of the data UI to build complementary insights from the sim UI.
