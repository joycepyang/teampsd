13tlead: so far this has felt disconnected and I was hoping you could clarify the goals and purpose. Spend some time talking about why we should be invested.
11:22am
12: I would like a human answer on the purpose of MTL project. We know the data that you are already showing us we need. simplified language. 
11:24am
11tlead: I think we are struggling with the what and why. Yesterday’s meeting looking at the data was great. we work together. 
12: I don’t understand why people keep telling us that we are not communicating. We feel like we work great together, and we are cohesive
11:30am
lz: If you don’t feel like the data clashes with your perceptions, it is true that this simulation project may not be helpful, but if you’ve ever felt a mismatch of data and perception of your work, that’s what the simulation will help you with. 
11:35am
lz: shares user interface and ability to test / simulate different questions to see immediate feedback instead of waiting and finding out later. 
11:42am
lz: I don’t think team 1 generally feels disempowered the way other MH teams do.
11tlead: We already work with data all the time and have lots of it. going into the data and playing around with it, we may have questions there or find it useful.
