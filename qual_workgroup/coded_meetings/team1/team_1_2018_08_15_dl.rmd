Team members:
J
E

Facilitators: 
TR
DK

TR: Want to compare last experiment. Run a new experiment. Have you drive and be prepared to run an experiment on your own.
DK: We are winding down with the your team and MTL. We want you to be able to explore with the model on your own.
TR: [reviews the prior experiment]
E: Big change to graduate from 4% to 50%.
TR: [talks through stock and flow]
TR: Review of last experiment shows that the change they made did not make a big difference. 
E: I think we are keeping people in care longer. 
J: I think the initiation rate and the quit early rate are affected by changing our graduation rate. 
E: Why is that? What can we do? 
TR: Shows the Sankey chart. A new chart format for most people. [tries to show how the width of the bars is related to the number of patients in different statuses.
TR: You could affect all of them at once (the Red Sankey) by changing the RVI. Or we could change their engagement time after their initial three weeks. 
E: Ok (Emily and Jorin seem quite engaged). 
DK: Is this making sense for you? Useful?
E: I think some of this stuff is out of my control.
DK: So changing the RVI is more in your control? Or the engagement time after three months?
E: I am not sure. 
TR: Other teams have said that there is no specific guidance on how long to keep someone in care. 
J: True, and this is about the patients choice, too. 
E: These are very useful models, Tom. I think this is incredibly useful. But I would like to make decisions with higher ups.
TR: You as clinicians, are making individual patient decisions. But, the model, 
J: Let’s run a 100% grad rate. 
TR: So, that would changing Grad Rate and Engagement rate.
TR: Can you walk me through it?
E: Change Completers who Graduate. 
TR: Ok. Now how to we run?
E: Press run. 
TR: So, looking at the Starting Rate change, you have doubled the number of new patients who can start. 
J: So, let’s change the engagement rate, too, per Emily. 
[Bidu joined late]
TR: He is typing in the Experimental text boxes. To capture the current run. 
TR: So, what is the Decision?
J: Need more data! Not sure. 
E: I would Decide to push out (grad) a smaller percentage of patients. 
TR: Ok. 
DK: Can we see a chart that shows the difference?
TR: Here is the new chart. See that the purple bar is much wider. 
E: I am still not clear about how our changes would affect other clinics. Can we use the model to show this?
TR: The model we are using only looks at your team’s data. 
E: So we are looking at data in silos. 
TR: So, we are developing a new model that looks at PC and mental health service systems.
E: What if we have a six month cut off for all patients?
E: Can we do this?
TR: We can change the Engagement time. Let’s put it to -75%.
E: Are you going to Lake Tahoe, Tom? 
TR: Yes. 
TR: Let’s run this. 
E: Wow. This is much better. More impact. 
[The Sankey is really useful!]
E: We are a time limited clinic, but this data shows that this is what happens?
DK: Your Team’s data is in each of your individual worlds. So you can log in and play in your team’s world. Anything else you want to explore, at this point?
DK: When you see the Red and Green boxes, what else might you change?
DK: One of you said that you have control of some things, but not others. 
DK: Go to mtl.how/sim. You could go in and change the RVI and see the impact? 
DK: Would you do this, on a scale from 1 to 5? 
E: I know how, but do not have time time.
J: This is brand new to me. I had trouble getting in, but if I were at this screen, I think I could try. 
DK: Stacy is available to assist you with this! At anytime.
TR: Saves run. [shows how]
TR: From the Home screen, go to Experiment Maintenance. And you and rename the run here. 
DK: Home screen: Team Data Menu Maintenance is where you can find your team’s data files. 
DK: And once you run and save, we could then talk through the run with you (Lindsey and Stacy). 
TR: You can also export your run, and make your own graphs, and take this to your collegues. 
E: This was a straightforward, well run call. 
TR: So, now we need to reconfirm the next meeting.
