Attendees: 21, 22, 22, 23tlead
 (11:42)
Facilitator: lz

11:33-11:48 - Team completes survey

(Looking at overwork question)
	
22 & 22- We haven't had enough grid space to accommodate everyone - scheduling practicuum students.  There's been low staffing paired with increasing referrals and not enough availability
	

23lead- Don't have time for charting if everyone shows up. You have notes piling up on notes and you have to take your personal time whether leaving late/coming in early or during lunch.  This isn't great for time management and managers think we're getting it done in a regular tour of duty.


22- A lot of consultations are interactions with providers in/out of clinics outside of alloted scheduled time and takes away from note writing and not reflected in numbers

LZ - Consensus on issues of overworking and overbooking
