Can anyone restate Team 2  learning goal?


21
I know empowerment


21
Empowerment through education.. and something else?


22
Empowerment through education and exploration?

What does red font mean?

Team data


lz
Does it make sense that the number of pts in CC are defined by the number starting and ending, and we can calculate that by looking at the typical length of engagement?


21
Yes


lz 
As engagement time goes up, what do you think happens to starting rate?


21
Goes up

Level 1
21
It depends on the drop out rate.  The starting rate could be the same if the dropout rate doesn’t change.

Level 2

11:40a
lz
Links the starting, ending, and engagement rates in CC to traffic example.
Also to recap - What do we not have unlimited amounts of throughout the day?


All
Time


lz
As starting rate increases, the booking rate also increases. As starting rate goes down, the booking rate also goes down. Remember, the +/- don’t mean positive negative, but directions of change. Median engagement time and ending rate move in opposite directions.



If you don’t have unlimited time, there are only so many things you can do to increase slots


11:45a 
21
I don’t know the criteria of ending the relationship other than they don’t want to do it. If there could be some sort of policy of when to end CC, that could be really helpful.


lz
You can increase supply with additional staff, different allocation of appts (group vs. individual), etc., but generally there’s a limit to appt supply. Let’s think about a range of RVI intervals we would like to try to manipulate that.


21
3 months



23tlead
1-2 months


lz

As I’m increasing and decreasing the RVI, what do people notice? 


11:50a
21
(Increasing RVI) Appointments in CC going down
(Decreasing RVI) Patients in CC going up

Level 1
lz
Uses different RVI to look at how appt supply changes


11:55a
lz
What other things could you think about changing besides RVI? There’s also the information that 21 mentioned about when to step down pts from care. We haven’t also experienced with larger changes – i.e. if RVI was 5 months.  You can also think about if there’s some pts that could go on a tx holiday…


11:58a
lz
What did you guys notice today? Did anything stand out?


21
It was much easier to follow this on my own computer than in the conference room


All
Yes, that’s true for us too.


12:00p lz
What we want to do moving forward is look at team specific variables – i.e. no show rate, overbooking, changes to referrals to team, wait time etc.  We want to look at how these changes impact CC so we can apply them to the future models


21
You were talking about changing the visit rate, but our pts aren’t homogeneous.  Some pts need 6 months and some need 3 weeks. It’s hard to generalize across pts on what to do with our time.
I.F.

lz
Yes, this is true.  We’re never trying to replace the wisdom of clinical-based decisions but more want this to help people in framing.



Were any of the following adaptations made to today’s session? Please check all that apply and describe as necessary:
Lengthening/extending session time

Shortening/condensing session time

Moving ahead of session script

Missing parts of session script

Technical difficulties

Virtual facilitation

Facilitator/team dynamic:
What percentage of the session did the facilitator talk?
<10%		25%		50%		75% 		>90%
What percentage of the session did the team talk?
<10%		25%		50%		75% 		>90%

Comments/Notes:
* First 5 minutes spent on getting everyone connected
* All members of team present and diverse range of engagement across the team
* Team members emailed previously about not understanding how to connect to virtual facilitation and wanting extra instructions, but did not have much issues in getting connected virtually in the end.
