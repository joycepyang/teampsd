What do people remember about last time?


63tlead
We went over the fancy diagrams about how patients are getting booked


63tlead
We went over the helpful hints handout


63tlead
We went over the Care Coordination model as far as trying to find out what it is that we want to figure out what is useful for us.  What we think will happen and our findings based on our thoughts.


65
How to find the information in the data base.  What is filtered out – how to turn these on/off. Using Excel as a better way of getting into the information.


63tlead
We don’t have to open up the report every time but can use what you saved last time.


9:12am
64
Database had a lot of providers minus the peer support, so you showed us how to get to certain providers


9:17am
lz
(Showing Vensim diagram complexity 2) Does anyone know what this is showing?


9:18am
64
Start is intake or assessment part, patients in CC, and then they discharge?


9:25am
63tlead
Does CC end mean discharged note or if patient stops coming?


9:27am
64
What about drop-in clinics?  How are they reflected in the data?


9:32am
lz
What is your baseline return to clinic interval?


63
If treating for anxiety and doing EBT, then every two weeks.  If doing PTSD treatment, then every week.


63
If they’re stable and don’t want anything else, I tell them to call me when they want to see me or either 6 mo/1 year out depending on what pt wants


63
In above scenario, I do telephone appointments every 6 months.

Comments/Notes:
What is impact of 1 week vs. 1 year as the RVI on getting veterans into treatment?
