Introductions.
9:40am
lz: Pull up desktop and share MTL script.  Go through brief overview of session.  Explain do and done list items.
9:44am
lz: Who is going to be the team lead?
Team: Decides on 63tlead.
lz: It’s okay to have a backup person. Explains what team lead will do.
Team: Decides 63 will be backup.
lz: Explains that we want this to be about learning rather than performance measures.  We will be looking at both retrospective and future data.  The goal is to align visions not skip personal visions.  Think about a good learning experience?
9:49am
65: We developed as a group when we reached out to vets to develop care.
lz: 65’s example sounds like an outreach.
63tlead: We’re really good at collaborating i.e. for the retreat we divided work instead of all doing it and it really worked well.  We have 5 MHTC’s and each have an on call day.  It’s predictable.  Psychologists got alternative work schedules and MHTC’s were able to as well.
lz: You’re really highlighting several dimensions – collaboration and how quality of work life relate to quality of care.
63: Whenever we get a new directive, we get together to collaborate and plan.  Shoot for the moon.  We’re asked to do more with less.
61: We are proactive.  We know change is inevitable.  We want to be giving rather than receiving.
9:56am
lz: Moving forward, we want to create shared language.  We are only doing this until early spring and the hope is you all will continue using the resources.  Even though everyone is very in alignment, we want to prepare for times it will not.
9:58am
lz: Best case scenario looks like…?
63tlead: I’d like us to see clear data points whether it’s access or QI.
61: We have the perception that we do lots of work and we get great work done but leadership says it’s not enough compared to national standards.  We want to figure out how to get that aligned.
67: Adding to that issue, there’s a lot of staff turnover and shortage.
65: We are a true multidisciplinary team in the way we provide care.  We are kind of individualistic and we are all good at what we do.
lz: Wrap-up
