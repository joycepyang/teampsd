2.	Time management & trouble-shooting 

	started on time, took a few minutes for TL to share screens (first time)



3.	Attendance and engagement 

	missing many people, only had Vhee and Janet really participate



4.	How did the co-facilitation model go? 

	TR ran ~60% (intro, UI use, results explanation), and LZ ran ~40% (clarifying 	data issues and crafting hypothesis)


5.	What was covered during the meeting? 

	validated pt data and model params, TL took control of UI, developed 	experiment, and ran it


6.	What were the team's questions? (what did they ask?) 

	why don't these parameters look like our current reality?
	What does it mean to set the hours to x with the slider? Do we need to move 	other supply sliders, too?


7.	What is the team's guiding question and hypotheses? (what are they testing?) 

	o	Add these items to the agenda for Wednesday facilitation meetings 

	"increase hrs in EBPsy from 1 to 25, and decrease hrs in Psy from 25 to 1 -->
	1 to 25 patients in care in EBPsy"



8.	Facilitator needs/questions (need for training, problems) 

	figure out how to get the team familiar with their data params before running 	any experiments (too much clicking back and forth)


9.	Things that Team PSD should know - problems with UI, data, upcoming issues

	Don't assume that the teams have fully understood what a slider does! (e.g., that they can "create" hours accidentally, if they don't keep track of the total hours in their heads...it would be nice if there was a widget that kept track of the total hours in real time)
 

10.	Team Emails: 1) Done, 2) Do, 3) Decided 

1-validated pt data and model params, built hands-on familarity with UI, developed experiment and huypothesis, and ran it

2- re-run experiment (swap hours for PSY and PBPSY), view results

3- next experiment will include changes to both supply AND referral % to see desired impact
