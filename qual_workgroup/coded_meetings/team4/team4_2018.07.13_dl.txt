At 11:27am, Lindsey has everyone logged in. 
LZ: There are two worlds that you can use to log in. The team work and your personal world. Two log ins, same password. 
LZ: We want to pick up where we left off. We have a new data set. Anyone want to drive?
M: I will. [Starts Adobe Connect; LZ needed to promote him to presenter].
LZ: Everyone see M’s screen? 
YES
LZ: Choose start new session and choose the newest data set.
LZ: See warning about restarting? It is okay to say yes, but it resets the session for all team members.
M: Ok
LZ: Go to select Experiment. See the ?? It gives information about the Question, Hypothesis, Findings, and Decisions that we were working on.
LZ: Note no Decisions were made. 
LZ: Today we want to come up with a good basecase run for your team. 
LZ: Basecase is trying to tell you what the future would look like if nothing was changing over time. It is not realistic, but it gives you some level of camparison.
LZ: M, Please run a new Basecase. 
LZ: To set this up, in the Experiments title, turn use Team data ON. 
LZ: Let’s look at the values for all the variables being read in to the model.
LZ: [Reviews all the values, in brief] These are feeding the basecase model. [Taking quite a bit of time to clarify what the estimates mean. She does a good job, but is this necessary??]
LZ: Use Team data is really saying use the current, expected mix of values that characterize your team.
LZ: We also want to have all the causal loops ON. The Reveal option shows the feedback effects. By turning these on, all of these effects come into play. For example, xxxxx
LZ: The point of the SDM is not correlation, it is about examining the dynamic relationship among these variables. [404 Freeway analogy invoked]
LZ: There are many other things you may want to examine, for example effect of overtime and RVI.
LZ: To turn all of these ON, we need to go to the Sensitivity section of the Experiments Window. We are going to turn them on by setting them to 1. [What if not all set to 1? Multiplying by 1 is different then less than or greater than 1]
LZ: Now M runs the model. 
LZ: You can Compare Experiments or Compare Services, too, for the current run. Note that the Y axis is always changing. 
LZ: [Shows how to set Dashboard graphs]
JB: Note that you are not always seeing Zero on that access, either. 
LZ: Right. 
M: What can’t we see the WP lines for all the services?
LZ: They are all on top of each other, and we can deselect some of these. See?
M: Ok.
LZ: Did a reset, and started to discuss experiment [No new text entered and saved to describe Run].
LZ: We want to keep examining staff reductions in your team. 
LZ: So, we are out of time.
