Team 4 Meeting
Date: Friday, November 3
Attendees: 41tlead, 43, 41, 45, 42, lz, sp

Team meeting – Starting with pt discussion
* Patients are firing providers on whim
* Patients are difficult about in person visits (because tele-appointments exist)

Workshop session (team did not come with a case)
* 8:32a lz: Begin session by handing out worksheets and debriefing about the overall project and this session
o Point out that this is not “substitution” but “augmentation” of what clinic teams are already doing during team meetings
o Discuss how all teams are so different (i.e. everyone in Team 1 plays MHTC role to some extent)
o Overall goal: we want data to be transparent; will be aligning out work with SAIL framework 
* 42: Can you give 30 second explanation of SAIL?
* lz: Gives brief overview of SAIL measures
o MTL looks at when pt starts to end EBP
o SAIL looks at Q1, Q2, Q3, etc.
o We also want to emphasize/accomplish:
* Systems thinking competencies – thinking about how things all fits together
* Goals for team – learning goal, motivation, etc.
* 8:41a lz: Starts going through scripts
o We want to start building a shared goal in what is important to team
o Want to look at personal vision that can align with team
o Look not just at retrospective data but also ahead
* 8:43a lz: Think of a time you had a good learning experience and share?
* 41tlead: Not necessarily “breakthrough” but helpful when 41 talks about “PRIME” studies.  Team meeting is only time I get to hear about it.
* 45: Getting help with is diff pts; getting new ideas of different type of treatment that she didn’t think of
* 42: Good experience with discussing and conceptualizing patient.  41 showed me how to use visual aid for clinic appointment.  I think we could streamline process for referring someone to therapy - might be easier for with him just learning when he’s available with technology
* 41: One difficulty – one difference from Team 2 is that all of us are on multiple teams and we are only all together on Fridays.  Hard to operate as streamlined team because not everyone’s on same page about team/pt stuff – creates lots of rework
* 8:48a lz: Summarized what team brought up
* lz: What’s your “dream team”?  Thinking about all players, tech, data, communication ways, etc.
* 8:53a 42: Would be great to have data that is driven, transparent, and available in real time; drop down availability of therapy across clinics; real time ability to make clinical decisions; immediately resolvable
* 43: Good idea would be coming up with strength based approach and putting that in framework of multidisciplinary nature of team
* 41tlead: Team 7 between 751 and 761 seems better resources and connected to information for various situations and patients
* 43: So what info is useful and how can we contain and connect?
* 45: Used to having dyad with physician.  Want to use more resources.  Want to be more interdisciplinary to get more comments on patient care coordination
* 41: How to bring team into care coordination.  I felt team was most useful in how to conceptualize very different pt and getting different perspective on diagnosis and tx options; seconding 42 – issue of getting pts to proper tx option/clinician; Having case discussions is great.  A lot of time pt is only seeing one of us, so great to have platform to bring cases
* 41tlead: Does this mean you want someone else to also see pt besides you?
* 41: Kind of ? I want to be able to talk to someone about it
* 43: I feel the same way about it
* 42: The historical structure is for MD to involve MHTC when needed
* 9:02a lz: I’m hearing consistent vision of coming up with clear and more consistent ways to refer patients.  Fixing feelings of isolation.
* Wrap up with reviewing what we did today and what needs to be prepared for next time
