Attendees: 42, 41tlead, 41, 45, 41
Facilitator: lz
Coder: sp

8:43a
lz: Starts walking through data tool.  Asks for volunteers to “drive”
42: I can do it
lz: Shows different functions on Splash page

8:45a
lz: What are health factors?
All: Seem to be confused
lz: “Health factors” are what physicians enter in CPRS
41: we don’t see that?
lz: It must be called something different, but on the backend it’s called “health factors” i.e. suicide flags, MST., etc.
All: We call this “reminders”

8:48a
42: Drives excel and opens up the data
lz: It takes awhile to pull the data because it’s pulling 2 years of data.  So once you have it, save it until you need the most recent encounter again.  Do you want to choose clinics or providers?
42: Should we do all of us or one person?  
lz: Since most people joined the team in June, it might be better to do the whole team
**Tech issue: Encountering issues with selecting physicians.  The filters are pre-applied which is making it hard to “teach”.  Need to bring it up with Andrew.  This is meant to be an advantage because once you apply filters, you don’t need to reset it.

8:55a
lz: You can edit through the web app, but that makes it super slow.  Saving with specific filters means you can’t bring back other items.  You can search too if you want to spot checks on specific grids.

8:58a
lz: To recap, pull the file, and then I would choose all clinics, apply filters, etc. and then save it.  I think our engineer did this to save people time when working with the facilition team. I will make an excel file for you and you can play with it.  Who should we include? – everyone except (including peer support).
