8:20am - Complete menu

8:34am - Being review of menu results

8:37am LZ - What are the needs with regards to referrals?

41 - Is this MM or Psy?

41 - Referrals to MM.  45 refers to me, even i initial MAC consult was for psytx, she ends up referring to me.  I thin kit's reasonable for her to exercise that clinical judgment.  Feel like I don't do anything.  can understand.

41tlead - I've got some refs where people just don't want med from ref in team.

41 - Happens in being for psytx in our team, usually after evaluation

41 - We have 3 psychiatrists but no psychologist.  45 wants extra eyes

41 - It's teamwork

41tlead - I've been having a lot of intake slots not showing... maybe because of discharge.  But think there should be more than I can see.

41 - I think 45 just does "med" instead of "new med". Think it's just ismple logistic issue.

41tlead - I was doing lots of ref to practicum students but cycle change right now.

41 - I was told that if you are doing MM, send to MHTC to go to psytx.

41tlead - I've referred to therapy.

41 - We should know better than MHTC.

LZ - What's the third stop?

41 - Referral to get referral

41tlead - I think there's a push to make MHTC= clinician

41 - Patient should have MHTC before referring to MHTC

LZ - Are you (41tlead and 41) MHTC's on patients not on meds?

41 - Yes, but cramming into short time.  We will need more time doing CC and PSY at the same time.

LZ - What about the flip side?

41 - Yes, for example 45 is MHTC for patients but doesn't see them for more than 5+ years.
