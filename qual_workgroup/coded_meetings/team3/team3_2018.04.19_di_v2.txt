31tlead - One's where we all agree is very high.  For me, it's mostly MM; for 37 it's scheduling; for 32 and 32 its psychotherapy.  Biggest issue is we're down 8 doctorcs across the CBOC.  Worried about burnout within Telehealth because of short staff and doctors leaving because of burnout.  Katie is going on materiny leave.  No one in Sonora, Monterey, and Livermore.  Limited in Modesto.  San Jose and Stockton are best staffed.

32 - Potential for vicarious burnout.  Other clinics are leavning on Telehealth in an ineffective way.

32 - Developed idea as both treatment team and consultation team because staff are so maxed out.

32 - If I can't pick pu a referral, there would a parciular stress/emotional upset.

32 - I think upset is reflective of burnout and lack of support staff are feeling at CBOC's.

(Looking at RTC question - completely spread)

32 - Recently totally changed without telling anyone or training anyone.

37 - Getting used to it.

32 - RTC's are a hot mess.

37 - Navigation is in beta phase (MyHealthyVet).  So alot of bugs to remove easy to get lost in.  Not smooth. Issues with CPRS connection.

31tlead - Tying along with staffing.  Multiple people don't have TCT's and new people have been taking up but odn't know rooms.

32 - Taking out fucntions made it worse.  cannot create alerts.  Getting unrelate demails.  Always confused.

31tlead - don't have clerks.  we have tech specialists and when there's staff shortage we are overworked.

32 - Difference of responsbility and coverage.  Highlights where speciliazations directl links to efficiency.

31tlead - We have 2 grids - 1 for patients and 1 for providers.  Difficult to manage both - people cancel things.

32 - Couple times I did it and lots of moving parts.

32 - We know how to handle our schedules but system does not.

37 - Telehealth has to adjust.

End time - 8:46am
