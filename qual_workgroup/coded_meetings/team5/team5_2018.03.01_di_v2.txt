1:43 pm
lz: Have you guys talked about the challenges with when patients should return? is this something you guys have figured out?
52tlead: No. sufficiently does of treatment for women seems to be higher than women in general are using VHA.
53: Oscillations in the number of referrals we have depending on how many patients the women’s clinic sees cause a “feast or famine.”
1:50pm
53: myths in the system that we are only place that can do treatment. We have to refer patients somewhere else, but there’s resistance in our system. 
lz: How many more patients would you have to allocate to be able to start more individuals?
lz: User interface will be done by end of the month. We are wondering if someone could drive?
1:55pm
lz: What is your usual mental model for creating more slots?
53: More slots, more clinicians.
lz: But staff hiring is not something you can control and it feels disempowering.
1:58pm
53: I overbook all the time to handle the issues sometimes patients hand out in group treatment for a while hoping to get into individual therapy.
lz: What in the clinic is like the thermostat? How do you keep things balanced?
You refer out, switch services, or change when you see them again. The goal is not to come up with a rule, but to have more data on making the decisions.
