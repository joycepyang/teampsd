## Reschedule 9/5 meeting.  
Normally we would meet tomorrow next on 9/5. However, all of the TeamPSD facilitators will be in Chicago for MTL Facilitate training. We can reschedule on either the ***5th Wednesday - August 29 @10am*** or ***2nd Wednesday - September 12 @10am***.    
Please let us know what would make the most sense for your team.  

As a reminder, we are planning to spend August and September wrapping up Modeling to Learn. Thanks for piloting and learning with us!     
**Wrap Up #1:** Team Reflections and Decisions – Implementing a change in the team based on lessons learned and reflections from the simulation.   
**Wrap Up #2:** Technical Assistance Plans & Resources for Self-Directed Learning – Providing teams with resources, guides, and videos for developing and running future experiments.  
**Booster Sessions (Optional):**  Developing hypothesis and experiments to run in a new module  

Thanks!

Done | Do
Completed two experiments on graduation rate and engagement duration. | Experiment in individual worlds with RVI or with combination of experiments we've already done (graudation and engagement duration)
--- | We saw that we can increase our new patient starts by ~50%, if we graduate all patients who receive a complete timely dose of psychotherapy. As you meet with patients over the next 2-4 weeks, think about which patient you'd be comfortable talking with about graduation.
