**Meeting Info:** mtl.how/live | 1-800-767-1750; Code 27379    

## Reschedule 9/5 meeting.  
Normally we would meet tomorrow next on 9/5. However, all of the TeamPSD facilitators will be in Chicago for MTL Facilitate training. We can reschedule on either the ***5th Wednesday - August 29 @8:30am*** or ***2nd Wednesday - September 12 @8:30am***.  
Please let us know what would make the most sense for your team.  

As a reminder, we are planning to spend August and September wrapping up Modeling to Learn. Thanks for piloting and learning with us!    
**Wrap Up #1:** Team Reflections and Decisions – Implementing a change in the team based on lessons learned and reflections from the simulation.  
**Wrap Up #2:** Technical Assistance Plans & Resources for Self-Directed Learning – Providing teams with resources, guides, and videos for developing and running future experiments.  
**Booster Sessions (Optional):**  Developing hypothesis and experiments to run in a new module  

Thanks!

Done | Do
Further customized model to team around effect of work pressure on overtime. | Charts to look at: Actual hours available for service and RVI. Think about why RVI changes even though they've only made a change to overtime effect.
