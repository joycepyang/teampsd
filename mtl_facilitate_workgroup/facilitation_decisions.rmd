**Decisions to Finalize**  
1. Need to TEST/PREP in Version 1.52 to see the new functions for pulling up old text and for reading in the last experiment runs, new functions for saving runs  
2. Compare Services does not show results when you're only looking at previous runs. After RUN and SAVE for the current run it does.  
3. If you start a session showing what you did last time by copying the text from last time in to a fresh run (reset) - BECAUSE - you lose any text that you workshop if you revise the text, and haven't reset, but then need to reset for a new run.  

**Most current version Master Crosswalk here:** https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/tree/master/resources/master_crosswalk
The column labeled "Standard" is the Standard definition for that variable. If the variable in the same row in your MTL resource is purple, then it means you need to update your resource to make it consistent with the standard.  

**Planning**  
1. Facilitators should spend 1 hour debriefing to also plan facilitation for the next team meeting. This means setting up for 30 minutes pre (review script; technology); 60 minute team session; 60 minutes post debrief and plan; 30 minutes documentation/emails  
2. We decided to divvy co-facilitation lead roles into 1) (in green in schedule) to be the pre/post lead for all pre/post tasks; 2) (in yellow in schedule) live team meeting lead session. Both the live and pre/post lead should carve out the full 2 hours for their scheduled team meetings.  

**Tracking Session**  
1. When taking notes, number the unique pieces of content covered, turns in the conversation,  using a numbered list. This will help us to understand the typical content covered:  
- with timestamps how long specific topics take  
- across differences in teams and differences in duration of team meetings  
2. Teams will be numbered/de-identified according to their world mapping in Epicenter; In notes no one should be identified  
3. We should use "TLead" to capture comments/questions from the Team Lead.
4. We will use facilitator initials to identify coments made by facilitators, e.g., "lz"
5. Co-facilitators need to upload de-identified Team Meeting Notes to the Qualitative Workgroup Folder on GitHub (co-facilitators to upload during the post team meeting debrief): https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/tree/master/qual_workgroup/team_meeting_notes  

**Live Session**  
1. The base case run will have all team data on.  
2. We will have all loops on in the basecase run.  
3. Facilitators need to train learners to actively SAVE and LOG OFF when they are done using Sim.  
4. plural/time (patients/week or pts/wk) with the one exception for units of appointments, which is plural in word form, and singular in standard abbreviation for unit form "appt"  
5. It helps to bullet the findings, it makes it easier for learners  
6. Keep an eye on recording and moving the team toward higher level systems thinking in the FINDINGS text box, not just the HYPOTHESIS text box.  
	*Dimesions of Systems Thinking (codebook)*  
	a. multivariable complexity of relationship  
	b. closing feedback loops  
	c. system behavior over time (description of output linked to system causes)  
	d. more nuanced understanding of time (e.g., worse before better, short-run, long run)  
7. If there is a insight just from data this should be recorded as a finding too. Example is in one team last time we noted that 80% of their Service Proportion is Adjunctive and MM, our experiments are focused on other services. This is good to note in findings.  
8. Using language of "separate decision" (instead of independent decision) to describe different decision points in the model  
9. Naming files as 'human readable' and 'machine readable'. This means using all lowercase, no spaces (use underscores) and still captures the content of the file to anyone. Let's continue to use this across Forio, GitHub, TeamPSD directory, etc. 
10. Approved description of AGG service proportions: Of patients who engage with the team in a given service, these are the proportions of patients with at least one visit with the primary diagnosis shown.  Patients with a given diagnosis may engage in multiple services, and patients in a given service may be seen for different primary diagnoses.  Therefore, percentages may sum to more than one in both rows and columns. (pct)   
11. Stripped for rates any reference to module "ending rate" not "ending CC rate" for flows, but for units in stocks we'll keep the module detail (appointments in CC, patients in CC). - ***THE EXCEPTION IS AGG, where you need to pull up the rates by service.*** 
12. file names "yyyy_mm_dd_hhmm" (all lower case)  

**Five Domains of the Facilitation Checklist:**
1. Pre emails (completed according to the pre/post email publishing schedule) - Pre/Post Lead  
2. Pre meeting checklist (log-in to Lucid w/Co-Facilitation 30 minutes before) - Pre/Post Lead - For us now this will be in the Lucid Team Meeting  
3. During LIve Team Meeting (*need a Live session checklist) - Live Lead  
4. Post debrief checklist (30 minutes after) - Pre/Post Lead  
5. Post emails (completed according to the pre/post email publishing schedule) - Pre/Post Lead - For us now this will be in the Lucid Team Meeting  

**Pre/Post Email Publishing Schedule:**  
1. Draft emails for the next week (pre - week of Team Meeting or post - week without meeting) by end of Co-Facilitation Meeting  
2. Stacey to create .html emails by COB on Wednesdays and upload to GitHub  
3. Lead Co-facilitators review by 12noon Pacific/3PM Eastern on Fridays, for scheduled delivery to teams 8AM on Mondays
4. Email to include:  We decided subject line with do/done list (the "3 Ds")
	
**Team Management**  
1. Set up structure for handling potential team lead conflicts i.e. procedures to replace/demote a team lead or having a co-lead/alternate lead structure  
2. Build in structure for self-assessment and check-in with team lead throughout course as well as consider building in assessment items for the team to assses their internal team lead (and not just the external facilitator)  
3. Set up workflow/best practices for external facilitators to build relationships with local leadership/clinic directors  
4. Consider various workforce issues even beyond the team lead (i.e. harassment) and have clear framework for how we will approach these issues  
5. Draft knowledge and skills requirement for role of team lead
