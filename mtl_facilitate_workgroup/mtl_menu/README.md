# Team Participatory System Dynamics 

* Team PSD is using R and rMarkdown to format our participatory system dynamics facilitation resources.
* Posting our work on GitHub enables transparency, reproducibility and team collaboration.
* We are also using the RQDA package and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Reserach (CFIR) to code our PSD Development Process
