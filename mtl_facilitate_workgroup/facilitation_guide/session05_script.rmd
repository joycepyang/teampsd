# Session 5: Care Coordination, Part 2
## FACILITATOR PREP & FOLLOW-UP

### Overview
In this session, we walk through the flows and feedbacks related to ________, ________, and _________ in the Care Coordination model. This model shows how a variety of team decisions interact to affect multiple outcomes simultaneously. It lets you explore trade-offs between decisions such as desired new patient wait times, current patient return visit intervals, and overbooking, and how they affect team outcomes like total missed appointments, number of patients in care, and number of patients completing care.

### Learning Objectives  
1.	Identify at least three critical operating decisions that affect a team’s EBP reach given existing staffing.
2.	Explain the mechanisms by which a team’s choice to work more CC hours through overbooking can potentially produce two opposite effects on appointments scheduled.	
3.	Apply an understanding of the trade-offs of team-level overbooking to team decisions on responding to work pressure. 
4.	Explain the mechanisms by which a change in a CC team’s average Return Visit Interval can potentially produce opposing effects on appointments scheduled and patients waiting for their first visit.
5.	Apply an understanding of the trade-offs of team-level Return Visit Interval changes to team CC appointment scheduling decisions.
