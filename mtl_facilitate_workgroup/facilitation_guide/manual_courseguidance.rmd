Modeling to Learn is designed for teams of multidisciplinary staff in VAHS outpatient mental health, including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, counselors, certified peer-support specialists, other professional disciplines, and trainees (e.g., practica, interns, residents and fellows).

## Technology and Mechanics

    Adobe Connect – application, computer requirements, webcam, VOIP or phone recommended?
    
    Data interface in SharePoint – software?, browser specs, login, other? (Detailed instructions in Appendix C.)

## Course Schedule

    The course is designed to be delivered in twelve, 60-minute sessions. For many teams that have weekly huddles, every other week’s session will be devoted to MTL, so the course will take place over a period of 6 months.

    While the course progresses through increasingly complex concepts and models, each session stands alone to the extent possible, so that someone who misses a session or joins the course in-progress can participate with minimal extra coaching.

    The course at-a-glance is shown below. [add Overview paragraph and Learning objectives]
