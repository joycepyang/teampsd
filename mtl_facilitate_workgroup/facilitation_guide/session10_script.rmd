# Session 10: Aggregate, Part 1
## FACILITATOR PREP & FOLLOW-UP

### Overview
In this session, we walk through the flows and feedbacks related to ________, ________, and _________ in the Aggregate model.  This model shows the interactions between all services offered by your team.  It allows you to explore the impacts of how you allocate time across services and change within team referrals after patient intake.  It is also possible to experiment with your team’s willingness to use overtime as a solution to a large backlog of appointments, and how sensitive your team’s morale, quality of care provided, and burnout are to working long hours.
