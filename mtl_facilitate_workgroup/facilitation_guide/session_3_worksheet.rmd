Title of Program: Modeling to Learn, Session Three: Care Coordination Part I

Client Program Office: National Center for PTSD- Training and Dissemination Division

Program Start Date(s) and time(s): TBD

Purpose Statement:  

Over the past decade, Veterans Health Administration has invested in the dissemination of evidence-based psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies (EBPs) in the outpatient mental health system. [1-3] based on substantial evidence of EBP effectiveness as compared to usual care. EBPs are high value treatments that meet veterans’ mental health care needs and can reduce chronic impairment, and prevent suicide and overdose. [4-9] Despite the evidence of effectiveness, access to EBPs may not be timely and the reach of EBP for common and costly high risk concerns – PTSD, depression and opioid use disorder – can be low (3%- 28%). [10-12]  As a result, the Veterans Administration prioritizes high-value quality improvement statements to increase timely Veteran access to effective mental health care.
Participatory systems dynamics modeling can be an effective process for local staff to employ to address these gaps in timely access to mental health care through process adjustments and rapid tests of change. This training program is a series of remotely facilitated workshops with front line clinic teams to develop their systems thinking and systems dynamics modeling skill.

The course provides data visualization and simulation tools that allow participating staff the opportunity to understand the factors that affect EBP reach, develop shared insights to improve team decision-making and implement  and test plans to determine which approaches are more likely to achieve desired outcomes related to timely access to mental health services.

The purpose of the course is to enable local clinic staff to use their clinic data to make decisions for optimizing local EBP reach.

Target Audience:  The Modeling to Learn workshop series is designed for teams of multidisciplinary staff in VAHS outpatient mental health, including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, counselors, certified peer-support specialists, other professional disciplines, and trainees (e.g., practicum, intern, resident and fellow).

Objectives: 

1.	Explain how a team’s choice to work more care coordination hours through overbooking can have unintended consequences for scheduling.
2.	Describe trade-offs between allocating appointments for new versus existing patients in terms of rates of completion of evidence-based treatments. 
3.	Articulate two decisions within a team’s control that can help it optimize the reach of evidence-based practices among veterans it serves.
