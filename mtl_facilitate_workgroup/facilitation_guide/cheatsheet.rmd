## How do I get to the data?  
1. When you follow the SharePoint link, then... use Internet Explorer  
2. When you get to the Splash Page, then... open your team folder  
3. When you open the team folder, then... open the most recent Excel file  
4. When you see clinic grids hidden, then... move the column over to see them  
5. When you see the "refresh error," then... go to data or Pivot Chart data to refresh  
6. When you don't see something you expect, then... check to clear filters ("funnels")  
7. When you want to save the file, then... rename and watch to save to a location for PHI (default is team folder)  

## What are 4 ways to save time?  
1. Look at clinic trends on the splash page  
2. Use the most recently saved data file  
3. Save a file with your preferred filters  
4. Open the excel file in the morning, check it when you have 5-10 minutes throughout the day (lock computer in-between use)
