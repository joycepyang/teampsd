## Appendix D. Using the Modeling to Learn Interface in Forio

Forio is the company providing the Epicenter Platform where the VA PSD Simulation (sometimes, just referred to as "simulation"), based on the four Vensim models (sometimes, just referred to as "models") can be accessed.

Author - In Epicenter, an Author has "superuser" capabilities like access to the Epicenter directories. They also can "impersonate a user".  Key members of the VA PSD team (PI and others) as well as Forio team members are Authors.  

End User - In Epicenter, an "end user" is anyone who can "play" the simulations built on Epicenter. In our case, it's the Facilitators and participants (e.g., members of the ATS Team at Menlo Park).  

Access as an Author or End User is done via different login credentials. This is to clarify for Epicenter which permissions to grant to the individual. 

End Users can be Facilitator/Admin, Team Lead, or Player.

A World is Epicenter’s construct that allows us to assign the Team Lead and Player to the same VA PSD team. For our purposes, a "team" = "World". 

A Facilitator is set at a "Group" level. They are not assigned to a particular “World” but have access to all the "Worlds" in the Group. They also have access to features such as "chat with a Team Lead", "compare team results", etc.  A Facilitator can access the results of the different teams, but is NOT on a team, and therefore does not have the ability to run an experiment.

Each team (or World) will have one Team Lead who will have the "gameplay" capabilities, such as making decisions, playing the simulation, saving results, etc. 

Each team will have additional Players, who will also have "gameplay" capabilities, but not the ability to "start" a game. A team can only have one active game at a time.

Some individuals may be given multiple login credentials. For example, a Facilitator can "run experiments as a team member" if they log in as Player on a team. Also a person who is on more than one team can have login credentials for each one.
