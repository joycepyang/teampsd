# MTL Glossary of Terms

### *A ‘holy smokes’ definition of...*

**Action:** We don’t have time to sit around a conference room all day considering actions that we never take. Modeling to Learn helps us to save time and money arriving at consensus and coordinating a change by analyzing the causes and local conditions that give rise to gaps in quality and restructuring those dynamics for a better pay off for Veterans.  

**Alternatives:** There isn’t an only one way forward. Modeling to Learn helps frontline staff to compare alternatives. Staff can safely check out the pay off associated with single changes are combinations of changes. They get feedback about these alternatives and their trade offs immediately in real time.  

**Best:** Everybody in VA from central office to the frontline staff wants to know when they’re doing the best they can with the resources that they have. Modeling to Learn helps us to find any improvements that we can make now rather than passing the buck because not all improvements are within our own local control. The key is to find ways to optimize what we are doing so that we are always getting better at meeting our Veterans needs.  

**Charting:** Charting is a really important component of providing high-quality care to veterans, but no provider got into healthcare to enter data all day. Yet, many providers spend a big chunk of their day entering data into charts. It’s not fun or fair to only see this day to come back in a performance review. It helps increase accountability, but it’s not the fastest way to lead to improvement due to the delays in that system. Providers need to see how their charting becomes data.  

**Control:** We prioritize the decisions of frontline staff with our resources so that they can focus on the things within their control. Decisions that are appropriately made at the point of care by competent, compassionate professionals. The scope of the problems that are models address are designed to prioritize things the providers may not at first realize that they can impact with their day-to-day decisions.  

**Data:** Every team wants to understand how all that charting to do all day becomes data at the VA uses. Almost every team wishes they had data to understand a local problem they’re trying to fix. Everybody wants to understand how their patients map to the data. Everybody wants to learn from data not feel punished by it. There is strength in numbers and healthcare data should be a common resource used for good.  

**Decision:** VA care is based on shared decision-making. Decisions are shared among providers, and between providers and patients. Providers need ways to resolve disputes about what should be done for patients. Care coordination and quality improvement decisions are interrelated in our teams and should be considered together during team huddles.  

**Drive:** In order to learn, you have to be in the driver’s seat. You need to know how to get good information and how to put it to use. MTL believe the resources for quality improvement should be shared equitably across all layers a VA. We all share the same mission and we all need the best, timely information appropriate to our day-to-day decisions.  

**Dynamic:** Despite the complicated nature of improving care in the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States there are some common causal dynamics that frontline staff can be empowered to understand and manage improve the quality of care and their quality of work life.  

**Empower:** Modeling to Learn is designed to help providers to gain greater control over the resources governing the quality of care they provide veterans. We aim to help providers reach the full potential of their calling to help Veterans achieve their best lives, as they see and improve the best VA practices.  

**Learn:** Improvement requires learning. Mistakes have consequences in the real world, so we need ways to fail fast and cheap I prototyping ideas safely via simulation learning. We approach our data and our team meetings differently when learning is the goal then one of performance is the goal. Learning is key to improving performance.  

**Local:** Changes are more likely to be optimized if they can account for local capacities and constraints. Things should be scaled only when they make sense for supporting everyone everywhere. When used as a tool for learning and communication data makes sense to be defined in a standard way and interpreted in a local way. MTL has ways to do this faster and with more locally actionable insights.  

**Menu:** Every team needs options. Things change over time and VA providers need resources that address complexity and help them to pivot as things change.  

**Need:** Every team has a top priority need right now. No team has any time for solutions that don’t meet their needs or solutions designed to work somewhere else. Teams need to know what will work to meet their needs why it works.  

**Online:** We meet online so that there’s no cost for travel and people can gain insights right from their desk. Every hour that you’re focusing on quality improvement is an hour you’re not serving a Veteran directly. We want to get the biggest bang for our buck that we can and we built modeling to learn to be in digestible chunks I can fit into normal team meetings don’t require a lot of fancy footwork for scheduling. Just a substitution of activities at two meetings per month for six months. Focus of the team meetings is the same with the goal of getting Veterans better.  

**Patients:** Patients interaction with care includes many dimensions and it’s really hard to get all of them right, all the time and every where. Amazingly, veterans get significantly better with a lot of our highest quality treatments. Veteran patients deserve our very best and everybody here is dedicated to the mission to serve them. Therefore providers need the best tools to meet their needs and find ongoing improvements.  

**Phone:** You might want to run a quick simulation on the fly like you might do for a financial decision or weight loss decision. You can do that from your phone.   

**Plan:** Every team needs a working plan guiding individual providers decisions. Providers make hundreds of decisions all day long that impact veterans journeys through care. A learning plan helps to provide consensus around the team hypotheses to test for improving quality.  

**Questions:** Modeling to learn prioritizes asking questions staking a claim about what you think you’re going to fine and being willing to be surprised by what you experience during your experiments. Stay curious and open to each other‘s questions to find new insight that could guide your care decisions.  
**Scheduling:** No team has unlimited hours. No team has any use for improvement strategies that place unrealistic demands on our time or would require more time than they have. Managing appointments well he’s a key part of getting veterans the right treatment at the right time. It can be challenging to manage schedule as well to get enough new patients and care well also serving the needs of our current patients. Providers need more insights about how scheduling decisions overtime add up to impact Veterans’ journeys thru care.  

**Staffing:** Nobody can wave a magic wand and change the staffing of their local clinic. If the only ideas we have about had improve quality or to hire more staff it leaves providers feeling disempowered because it’s outside of their control. Yet, staffing changes are constant in any healthcare system as staff turnover. Staff turnover has a major impact on the quality of care. Understanding the role of staffing has to be taken into consideration with other factors team space in their clinics.  

**System:** Modeling to learn redefines the ‘system’ from the healthcare system to the system dynamics quality problems. In doing so, it identifies levers for change that previously were invisible.  

**Team:** Every team really is different, with the different staffing mix, a different patient population served, sometimes even a different purpose (specialty versus BHIP). Not all providers, provide every service. Multidisciplinary care requires coordination and it’s complex. No single provider can get every patient to the right treatment at the right time alone.  

**Test:** Modeling to Learn and powers frontline teams to test their quality improvement plans before the difficult work of trial and error in the real world. Frontline staff and patients are the closest to quality problems. So, the most important hypotheses to test related to Veterans’ addictions and mental health care plans are the ideas frontline staff have about ways to get our highest quality care to all of our Veterans.  

**Time:** There’s more than one way to think about time. There’s VA measured time and providers actual time. Sometimes something may seem like a good idea in the short run, but over time it leads to worse results.  

**Tradeoffs:** Every team decision is likely to impact multiple things. Tools to better understand balance these trade-offs are critical to avoid the paralysis of doing nothing. Modeling to learn helps people find the improvements with the greatest yield for most, and help to improve providers confidence by testing for unintended consequences upfront.  

**Transparent:** An essential value of Modeling to Learn is that things should be transparent to frontline staff, managers, patients and policymakers. Data, models, processes for making decisions, they should all be transparent and accessible to other scientist and to the public. Nobody trusts her makes decisions based on something that’s hidden from them. Everyone has a stake in making sure that we improve veterans addiction and mental health care, but we don’t all have the same stake. We strive to increase the accessibility of resources and each stakeholders’ capacity for using MTL resources. One of the most exciting things about Modeling to Learn is that it makes the causes of quality problems transparent.  

**Vision:** Every team includes providers who have a personal vision of why they get up in the morning to work in VA addiction and mental health. Every team has a unique reason that they can come together and learn using new tools to augment their work.  

**Why:** Understanding what causes what and why is critical to truly understanding anything. You need to understand why things work the way they do in order to identify new solution, coordinate with other people. You can review data all day and you still might be guessing about what it explains what you’re seeing in the data. Even a clear gap doesn’t necessarily point to the way I’m closing it. Even a great success doesn’t necessarily tell you how you got there or how you will sustain it or whether you erase it with the next change make. You have to understand the mechanisms forgetting improvements you want in order to take effective action.  

**Work life balance:** Disempowered providers do not empower Veterans. The quality of care veterans receive in the quality of work life providers experience are closely intertwined and cannot be separated. Recovery is possible and we have to promote wellness among staff so that they can support the well-being of the patient they serve.
