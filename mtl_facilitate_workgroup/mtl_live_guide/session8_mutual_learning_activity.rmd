# MTL Facilitate Pilot

# **Sequencing Learning Activity**
# Actual Order (correct or add to as needed)
* Login to the data UI (MTL.how/data)
* Create a team data file in the data UI.
* Save the team data file on Forio Epicenter….your desktop?
* Upload a team data file to the simulation UI.
* Login to the simulation UI (MTL.how/sim)
* Confirm the correct teams’ data file is linked to the model simulation you have started.
* Reveal complexity in the simulation UI.
* Confirm all of the Experiment sliders are showing “BC” before you run an experiment.
* Confirm the Sensitivity sliders are at “1” before you run a base case (BC) simulation.
* *Expand* the Outputs tile to see if a BC run was done using the a recent dataset (run within the last 30 days).
* Run a base case in the simulation UI.
* Name the base case run in the simulation UI.
* Explore the team data and discuss areas for change or improvement.
* Help the team formulate the text for “Our Question” – what the team wants to learn from the experiment – in the Outputs expanded tile.
* Help the team formulate the text for “Our Hypothesis” – what does the team expect to observe as a result of system changes “the systems story” – in the Outputs expanded tile.
* Change the values for appointments or patients in the Experiments tile.
* Run an experiment in the model.
* Save and name the experiment in the model.
* Examine and discuss the results of the experiment and document the insights in the *Our Findings* in the Outputs expanded tile.
* Identify possible adjustments VA healthcare teams can make to patients and/or appointments based on the MTL results and document is in the “Our Decisions” box in the Outputs expanded tile.

# Activity: The MTL activities below are in the wrong order. Your task is to reorder them so they occur in the right sequence. 
Write the number in the right column to show the order in which the activities should actually occur when you first begin to facilitate a MTL experience for a team.
#1 represents the first step; #17 represents the final step in MTL
