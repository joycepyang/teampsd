# MTL LIVE 12-Session Team Learning Plan***

## KEY PRINCIPLE: Systems Thinking should be introduced throughout

### SAME FOR EVERY TEAM

#### 1. session 1 - team vision

DO in-session GUIDE exercise: select team vision and team lead

DO post-email self-directed exercise:

Session Systems Thinking Target (4 CFBT Dimsnions - Complexity, Feedback, Behavior & Time):



#### 2. session 2 - team data #1

- data UI

DO in-session exercise GUIDE for familiarity/navigation/how-to:

DO post-email - team lead: Select the team and produce the data

DO post-email self-directed exercise - guide encourages thinking about what it might mean, clinically: look for specific things in the data UI

Session Systems Thinking Target (4 CFBT Dimsnions - Complexity, Feedback, Behavior & Time): Think about systems explanations for team trends



#### 3. session 3 - team data #2

- sim Model Parameters

DO in-session exercise GUIDE for familiarity/navigation/how-to:

DO post-email self-directed exercise: - team lead: produce model sim parameters,

team: Find specific things in the sim Model Parameters

Session Systems Thinking Target (4 CFBT Dimsnions - Complexity, Feedback, Behavior & Time):



#### 4. session 4 -  team need & plan (MTL menu) - Facilitated in MTL Menu 

DO in-session exercise:

DO: try to start clarifying a question  - give the team an exercise for clarifying a quesiton, based on what they observed in team data, and decided to focus on using the MTL menu -  related to what is covered in that particular modeling module

Session Systems Thinking Target (4 CFBT Dimsnions - Complexity, Feedback, Behavior & Time):



### SIMULATION LEARNING MODULES begin TAILORED TO TEAM

#### 5. session 5. Start a module based on MTL menu results and discussion

- how to upload their team data file to the sim UI

- get really oriented to sim UI team data table in experiment tile

DO in-session exercise GUIDE for familiarity/navigation/how-to:

DO post-email self-directed exercise - guide encourages thinking about what it might mean, clinically:

team lead a) upload new model sim parameters file,

DO team b) exercise where they look for a team data variable in the diagram and a) read the "i" test in the team data table, and b) look in the diagram to see what's it's related to

- Questions like: What types of decisions does the team make related to (variable) appointment supply, Return-to-clinic Visit Interval (RVI).

- KEY Idea: MTL is designed to empower frontline staff to improve decisions ar their level of control.

- **These questions will be the seque between the team data table in the experiment tile and finding it in the diagram. [Have them drive clicking the "i" - find the red variable in the diagram]

- Tilling the soil for next session when we will begin to learn how to tell a "systems story"

Session Systems Thinking Target (4 CFBT Dimsnions - Complexity, Feedback, Behavior & Time):



#### 6. session 6. 

- get really oriented to the sim UI main tile model diagram

- learn how to tell a systems story using the model diagram 

- Begin to enter question text in this session

DO in-session exercise GUIDE for familiarity/navigation/how-to:

DO post-email self-directed exercise - guide encourages thinking about what it might mean, clinically:

explore things in the model diagram on their own - draft exercise for this

Session Systems Thinking Target (4 CFBT Dimsnions - Complexity, Feedback, Behavior & Time):



#### 7. session 7. 

- open expanded output screen start to flesh out question/hypothesis

- team lead runs a bc and relate model diagram to output tile and expanded outputs screen.

DO in-session exercise GUIDE for familiarity/navigation/how-to:

DO post-email self-directed exercise - guide encourages thinking about what it might mean, clinically:

explore things in relationship to the bc on their own - draft exercise for this

Session Systems Thinking Target (4 CFBT Dimsnions - Complexity, Feedback, Behavior & Time):



#### 8. session 8.

- team lead is facilitated in putting more of four dimensions systems thinking in hypothesis

- run exp 1 - part of their question

- compare exp 1 to the bc in expanded outputs and add findings

DO in-session exercise GUIDE for familiarity/navigation/how-to:

DO post-email self-directed exercise - guide encourages thinking about what it might mean, clinically:

explore the comparison of bc and experiment 1 on their own - draft exercise for this.

Session Systems Thinking Target (4 CFBT Dimsnions - Complexity, Feedback, Behavior & Time):



#### 9. session 9.

- run exp 2 - another part of their question

- compare bc, exp 1 and exp 2 in expanded outputs - faciliated to describe in findings using four dimensions of systems thinking

- get introduced to more features of the UI (compare experiments vs. services [AGG], look at specific diagnostic cohorts [MM], look at the bronze, 

DO in-session exercise GUIDE for familiarity/navigation/how-to:

DO post-email self-directed exercise - guide encourages thinking about what it might mean, clinically:

Run exp 3 on their own, share with others, using share, and prepare for facilitated discussion with the team - draft "how to" guide and discussion worksheet for this.

Session Systems Thinking Target (4 CFBT Dimsnions - Complexity, Feedback, Behavior & Time): describe in findings using four dimensions of systems thinking

1. Complexity - increasingly multi-variable, interdependenc complexity

2. Feedback - increasingly more complete - close their feedback loop, intermediate variables

3. Behavior - increasingly link the observed system behavior to the structure

4. Time - increasingly sophisticated understanding of change over time; e.g., worse before better

#### 10. session 10 -  facilitated discussion of experiment #3 with the team

- select a new question and module

DO in-session exercise GUIDE for familiarity/navigation/how-to:

DO post-email self-directed exercise - guide encourages thinking about what it might mean, clinically:

Session Systems Thinking Target (4 CFBT Dimsnions - Complexity, Feedback, Behavior & Time):



#### 11. WRAP-UP #1 - Team Reflections and Decisions

- Based on everything learned what additional decisions and next steps should the team consider - HOW TO IMPLEMENT what they learned.

- DO: A change in the team, implement learning in some way - need to draft supports for the team in doing this.

Session Systems Thinking Target (4 CFBT Dimsnions - Complexity, Feedback, Behavior & Time):



#### 12. WRAP-UP #2 & Technical Assistance Plans - Other MTL modules and how to get help

- make a do plan for after the wrap of MTL team meetings.

- **use an example of their needs/questions (mtl.how/menu) to point to the other availble modules MTL Video available, self-directed learning with guides**

- reflection on team vision and GRADUATION
