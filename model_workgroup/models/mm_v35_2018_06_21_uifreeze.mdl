		patients are not sensitive to small changes in other MM task time; an \
		exponent greater than 1 indicates that patients are very sensitive to \
		small changes. Example: if a team is putting in 20% more hours per week \
		than their official supply, then an exponent of "1" would indicate that \
		the ratio of missed appointments to all appointments would also be 20% \
		higher than the base case. A value of 0.5 would cause that same 20% \
		increase in hours worked would only cause a 9.5% increase in the missed \
